    <dc:source>Sharks have patrolled the oceans for at least 400 million years and evolved into a huge range of remarkable species.There are deep sea lantern sharks that glow in the dark, wobbegong sharks that grow shaggy beards, and majestic, plankton-sifting whale sharks - the biggest fish in the sea.Nevertheless, when many people think of these animals, one thing comes to mind: shark attacks.As a beachgoer, diver or surfer your chances of encountering a shark, let alone being killed by one, are in fact incredibly slim; lightning strikes, bee stings and car accidents all pose far more of a threat than sharks.In reality, people kill millions more sharks than sharks kill people.A quarter of all shark species, and their relatives the rays, are threatened with extinction, according to a recent report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).The main threat to sharks is overfishing and in greatest peril are the largest species.Shark-repellent wetsuitsBut a controversial cull of sharks was recently ordered in Western Australia following a spate of attacks.Scientists are now looking at other approaches to deal with the shark attack issue.Prof Shaun Collin is leading a University of Western Australia (UWA) team of neurobiologists who are learning to think like sharks."We're trying to tread this very fine line of protecting both humans and sharks at the same time," Prof Collin told the BBC World Service programme Discovery.</dc:source>

    <dc:source>Thousands of PCs around the world have been paralysed by a security update that wrongly labelled part of Windows as a virus.The update was sent out by security firm McAfee and made affected PCs endlessly restart.Corporate customers of McAfee seemed to be hardest hit but some individuals reported problems too.McAfee apologised for the mistake and released a fix to ensure PCs started working again.Thousands hitThe problems were caused by an update to the long list McAfee's anti-virus uses to identify which programs are malicious.McAfee's 5958 update wrongly identified the Windows svchost.exe file as the wecorl.a virus. This worm tries to replace an existing svchost file with its own version to help it take over a machine.The update wrongly labelled svchost as the virus and then quarantined it. This caused many PCs to crash as Windows uses many copies of the file to keep the operating system going.Computers inside businesses running Windows XP with service pack 3 applied were the hardest hit according to reports. The University of Michigan said 8,000 of its 25,000 computers were hit by the faulty update.The SANS Internet Storm Center said the update was causing "widespread problems" and said it received reports about "networks with thousands of down machines and organizations who had to shut down for business until this is fixed."Analyst Rob Enderle said the update "pretty much took Intel down today". Mr Enderle was at the chip giant's HQ for a meeting when the widespread crash started to hit the computers of the people with whom he sat."We believe that this incident has impacted less than one half of one percent of our enterprise accounts globally," said a statement from McAfee, adding that an even smaller percentage of its consumer customers were hit.It said it removed the update "within hours" and released an updated file free of the mistake. It also issued a "sincere apology" for the inconvenience caused.</dc:source>

    <dc:source>It may not have California's weather, ocean views or coffee culture, but a Moscow suburb will be the site of Russia's version of Silicon Valley.Skolkovo district has been selected as the site for a huge science park, where the government will invest billions of dollars to help boost the nation's technology industry.It is a sleepy, rural area about 20 kilometres west of central Moscow, where wealthy Russians have dachas, or holiday homes.The park will be built on land owned by Russia's ministry of agriculture near the village of Nemchinovo.It is a small place where the action is limited. There is a bus stop and a kiosk selling newspapers and snacks.But Skolkovo will have some important attractions.Tax breaks and other funding will be offered to selected companies.The project will also be largely autonomous with its own water and power supplies amenities that can often be frustrating to secure for Russian companies.The project has powerful leadership. The Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg is in charge and he hopes that one day the region will produce Nobel Prize winners.Also, big new business school is being built on the edge of Nemchinovo, with upmarket houses and flats nearby.Konstantin Sonin, a professor of economics at the New School of Economics in Moscow, is optimistic about the project's potential.But he also warns that there is a danger that it will go the old Russian way, everything that is going to be built is going to involve a lot of corruption and bribery that will drive up the cost of everything.</dc:source>

    <dc:source>Some of the UK's most esteemed artists are to be showcased at the latest British Art Show - the survey of contemporary art held every five years.Painter Phoebe Urwin and former YBA Sarah Lucas are among the 39 artists whose work will form part of the exhibition.The work on display includes sculpture, painting, installation, photography, film, drawing, video and performance.British Art Show 7 will tour Glasgow, Nottingham, London and Plymouth.'Significant contribution'The British Art Show - which began in 1979 - is seen as one of the most influential events on the cultural calendar.Work by artists such as Damien Hirst, Sam Taylor-Wood and Chris Ofili were showcased in 1995, and all four nominated artists on the Turner Prize list in 2005 were included in that year's exhibition.This year's 39 selected artists have been chosen on the grounds of their "significant contribution to contemporary art in the last five years".They include Argentine-born painter Varda Caivano, sculptor Mick Peter, collaborative filmmakers Anja Kirschner and David Panos, and 75-year-old Scottish artist Alasdair Gray.It is hoped hundreds of thousands of visitors will visit the touring show, which is organised by the Hayward Gallery.Ralph Rugoff, director of the Hayward Gallery, said the show had always been, and continued to be, at the "forefront of innovation".He said: "The curatorial premise of the British Art Show 7 allows visitors the chance to discover younger artists, and also re-evaluate and reconnect with artists whose work they thought they were familiar with, but whose new developments hold many surprises."British Art Show 7 - subtitled In the Days of the Comet - is curated by Lisa Le Feuvre and Tom Morton.They said: "Our subtitle is taken from HG Wells' 1906 science fiction novel In the Days of the Comet."We are interested in the recurrent nature of the comet as a symbol of how each version of the present collides with the past and the future and the work of the artists in British Art Show 7, in many different ways, contest assumptions of how 'the now' might be understood."The British Art Show 7 will open at Nottingham Contemporary on 23 October, before moving to the Hayward Gallery, in London, on 14 February 2011.It will be at Glasgow Centre for Contemporary Art between May and August 2011, and at Plymouth Arts Centre from September until December.</dc:source>

    <dc:source>Sony has signalled what could be the final end of the venerable floppy disk.The electronics giant has said it will stop selling the 30-year-old storage media in Japan from March 2011.In March the firm stopped sales of the disks in most international markets due to dwindling demand and competition from other storage formats.The slow death of the "floppy" or "diskette" began in 1998 when Apple decided to not include a floppy drive in its G3 iMac computer.Since then various other firms have stopped support for floppy disks, including computer giant Dell in 2003.Computing store PC World stopped selling them in 2007.However, Sony has continued to sell the disks, and continues to ship them in the millions.Now, the firm - which claims to have produced the first 3.5in (9cm) disks in 1981 - has decided to halt sales completely faced with competition from online storage and portable USB drives.</dc:source>

    <dc:source>The Irish Republic's biggest lender said it would raise up to 1.9bn euros through a rights issue.The bank hopes to raise the rest of the money by placing shares with institutional investors, and through a debt-for-equity swap.Bank of Ireland was told to raise 2.7bn euros by financial regulators in March.The move is the latest stage in the recovery of the Republic's banking sector following a government bail-out in the wake of the global financial crisis.Irish lenders were hit hard by the collapse in the property market, which saw billions of euros-worth of home loans go bad.Last month, the government announced plans to inject more money into the banking system in order to further stabilise it, but no new government money was planned for Bank of Ireland.It is currently 16% government-owned, and was asked to raise cash privately to meet new capital requirements.It also needs compensate for losses on its bad loans that have since been transferred to the state-run "bad bank" - the National Asset Management Agency.The bank's cash raising plans also involve a possible change to the government's stake in the bank.Bank of Ireland plans to convert some of the government's preference shares - which give it certain privileges over ordinary shareholders - into ordinary stock.That is expected to see the government's stake increase to up to 36.5%.</dc:source>

    <dc:source>Avatar has become the fastest-selling home entertainment release of all time in North America, shifting 6.7 million DVDs and Blu-rays in four days.James Cameron's 3D sci-fi epic, released in the US on 22 April, sold 4 million DVDs and 2.7 million Blu-rays. The sales brought in $130m (Â£84.1m).The previous record holder in the US and Canada was The Dark Knight in 2008.Avatar is being released in the UK on Monday. Some stores opened their doors to fans at midnight.Film studio 20th Century Fox said the movie was also the fastest-selling release on the Blu-ray format alone in North America.It was released on 22 April - "Earth Day" in the US and Canada as well as other countries - to chime with Avatar's environmental theme, Fox said.Summer re-releaseThe science-fiction adventure, about a marine who infiltrates a race of giant blue aliens, is reportedly the most expensive film ever made, with a budget of at least $300m (Â£185m).In January, it became the highest-grossing movie of all time, overtaking the $1.843bn (Â£1.19bn) taken by 1997's Titanic - also directed by Cameron.The figures were not adjusted for inflation or the higher cost of Avatar's 3D film tickets.Last week, Cameron told the Los Angeles Times that Avatar, which mixes live action with digitally-created performances, would be re-released this summer with an extra six minutes of footage.He also told the paper the sequel to the film would be centred around the ocean on the planet Pandora.</dc:source>
